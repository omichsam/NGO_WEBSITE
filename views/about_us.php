                                their families every year, through 200 welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women
                                empowerment, in more than 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India. </p>
                            <p> Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like India, development of underprivileged
                                children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, and their education is the cornerstone of this
                                progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without ensuring the welfare of the family â€“ a child
                                can go to school regularly only when the family, particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the child
                                gets proper nutrition; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.

                                Realizing this, Charity Foundation, beginning in the corridors of education, has adopted a lifecycle approach
                                which addresses the needs of children, their families and the larger community.</p>

                            <p>Charity Foundation strongly believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the
                                process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Following this model of Civic Driven Change,
                                Charity Foundation sensitizes and engages the civil society, making it an active partner in all its welfare
                                initiatives.</p> -->
