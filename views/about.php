                 <h2>About Our Foundation</h2>
                 <p>Charity Foundation is a national level development organisation directly benefitting over 400,000 children and
                     their families every year, through 200 welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women
                     empowerment, in more than 950 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India. </p>
                 <p> Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like India, development of underprivileged
                     children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, and their education is the cornerstone of this
                     progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without ensuring the welfare of the family â€“ a child
                     can go to school regularly only when the family, particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the child
                     gets proper nutrition; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.

                     Realizing this, Charity Foundation, beginning in the corridors of education, has adopted a lifecycle approach
                     which addresses the needs of children, their families and the larger community.</p>

                 <p>Charity Foundation strongly believes that unless members of the civil society are involved proactively in the
                     process of development, sustainable change will not happen. Following this model of Civic Driven Change,
                     Charity Foundation sensitizes and engages the civil society, making it an active partner in all its welfare
                     initiatives.</p>
